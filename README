This is a simple program for the Adapteva/Epiphany/Parallella system to measure
different types of memory performance.  It attempts to let the mesh network
acquiesce, and then executes reads.

For Same or Other core memory, smdtest assumes
that the data will be returned in one read.  For external memory, a worst case
of two reads should be sufficient to return the data.  Note, two reads is only
adequate becuase the mesh network is otherwise quiet.

To quiet the network, external polling from the host is diabled by executing
a remote sleep before the memory tests are executed.  Additionally, the other
cores are also "idled" via the idle instruction after executing a number of
NOP instructions.

In an attempt to remove the clocks for the timing, a 'Tare' value is calculated
by executing the start and stop timer functions and subtracting it from the
calculated measurements.
